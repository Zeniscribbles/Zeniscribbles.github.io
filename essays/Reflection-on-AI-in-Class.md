# Ah yes, the dreaded dilemma of using AI in education

It’s quite the dilemma indeed, how much is too much, how little is not enough? I agree, AI can be detrimental to learning when abused. Unfortunately, our digital world is trekking on with or without us. Technology is outpacing the academic world, and students are racing to keep up with the expectation of future employers. 

So here is what I think: study smarter, not harder, and become a lifelong learner. Take my experience with a grain of salt, from the perspective of an Electrical and Computer Engineering student taking an ICS course in software development:

## Experience WODs e.g. E18

I used AI in the take-home WODs to refine my code, but to really try and understand the intricacies of TypeScript and React-Bootstrap. I found the video tutorials more useful, but sometimes I felt that the code just didn’t tell a story that I could follow.

## In-class Practice WODs / In-class WODs

I absolutely used AI during In-class Practice WODs/WODs. Unfortunately, I did not find that timed WODs contributed to my learning experience or my future career. Especially considering the WODs were website design, completely unrelated to my field of study. 

Although, the website design WODs were pretty fun and created a healthy competitive environment. In this case, I chased the grade and was more concerned about my grade than making these exercises a learning experience.

## Essays

I didn’t use AI in the normal sense, but I did use Grammarly. I personally really enjoyed the essays. I love writing, and I love telling a good story even more. I took the opportunity to write in the most whimsical and magical way possible.

---

## Final Project

Probably would not have survived without AI for the more complicated back-end tasks. AI was useful for finding solutions and discussing errors that were being experienced.

---

## Learning a Concept / Tutorial

Yes, AI was the TA that I needed. It served as a great tutor since we kinda crash course-d the languages we used in class.

---

## Answering a Question in Class or on Discord

I did not use AI for this. I wouldn’t recommend it either. Part of understanding what you're missing comes with asking questions. Most professors and TAs will catch your level of understanding pretty quickly based on how you asked your question.

## Asking or Answering a Smart Question

I did not use AI for this. I also do not recommend this. AI can give very fancy responses, but it defeats the purpose. The student asking or answering could have just had a convo with AI instead.

---

## Coding Example (e.g., “give an example of using Underscore .pluck”)

Yes, I used AI for this. For the same reason why I used AI as a tutor.

---

## Explaining Code

Yes, I used AI for explaining code. This helped me when I got stuck or couldn’t see or find the error I had made.

---

## Writing Code

Yes, I used AI to write code, especially for templating. It saved a lot of time.

---

## Documenting Code

I didn’t use AI for this. I had to explain the code if I didn’t understand it and then wrote my own comments and documentation.

---

## Quality Assurance (e.g., “What’s wrong with this code `<code here>`” or “Fix the ESLint errors in `<code here>`”)

Yes, I used AI for this. Although, not entirely useful. I found that my code ran even with errors.

Nope, that covers it.

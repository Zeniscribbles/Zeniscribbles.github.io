Dear reader, have you ever considered reinventing the wheel? Such a question sounds ridiculous, doesn’t it? 

Who in their right mind would reinvent the wheel? In software development, "reinventing the wheel" means

solving a problem that’s already been solved—often in less efficient or effective ways. As a novice software

developer, you may have done just that. Perhaps in your college career, you’ve spent hours crafting a 

solution, only to later discover that it already existed. Fret not; you’re just starting out, and the digital 

world is full of opportunities to learn and grow. Fortunately, there’s a way to avoid such pitfalls: the 

brilliant use of what we call design patterns. <br><br>


But what are design patterns? They are general, reusable solutions to common problems in software design. 

Think of them as blueprints or guidelines that help solve recurring issues consistently and efficiently. 

Although design patterns aren’t complete code, they embody best practices and concepts that can be tailored to 

meet the specific needs of your project. By using design patterns, developers can build scalable, maintainable 

systems while also gaining flexibility for future modifications. <br><br>


A simple and common design pattern you’ve likely used is the iterator pattern. The iterator pattern provides a 

way to sequentially access elements from a collection without exposing its underlying representation. For 

instance, consider a file reader that processes lines from a file one by one without loading the entire file 

into memory—essential for handling large files efficiently. In C, this can be achieved using the `fgets` function. 

With such an approach, you can easily count lines, bytes, and characters in a file while conserving memory.

So, dear reader, the next time you face a software problem, remember: you don’t need to reinvent the wheel. Instead, 

leverage the brilliance of design patterns to build efficient, elegant, and maintainable solutions. And rest 

assured—you’ve already started your journey by using design patterns, whether you realized it or not.

## A Personal View
  I don’t personally believe there is such a thing as a, stupid question. Once in a while when we ask questions, the person 

we are communicating with may not grasp what we're trying to convey–not because you asked a *“dumb question”*, but because 

it wasn’t communicated effectively. Communication is key, and dismissing poor communication as a *“dumb question”* is just 

as problematic as the communication gap itself. But is there a universal way to always articulate clearly?  In a world 

without magic, how do we ask a truly *“smart question”* ?


## Thoughful Guidelines 
  To ask a *“smart question”*, there are some guidelines we should consider first. Before you ask, you may want to consider 

if your question has been asked before. Try looking online to see if anyone has already experienced the same issue. You may 

want to seek answers in a manual, reading a FAQ, or by reviewing your source code again. In addition, sometimes the best 

solution is to perform inspection and experimentation. Lastly, you might want to ask the expert directly. Speaking with a 

friend or colleague who is more knowledgeable in your field or subject is a good start. When asking a question, it’s important 

to consider your audience. Avoid posting on forums where your question is off topic, or in a forum that is outside the scope 

of your knowledge. In addition, refrain from cross-posting multiple forums, or reaching out to strangers or those not directly 

responsible for resolving your issue. 

   When posting a question on a forum, your subject headers should be clear and descriptive. A well-crafted subject line not 

only attracts the right experts but also helps others with similar issues find solutions more easily. When writing out your 

question, ensure your question is written with correct grammar and spelling. Maintain a professional tone in your post, and 

follow any formatting and guidelines provided in the community rules. Your question should be precise and concise: include 

the necessary details like symptoms in chronological order, your IDE, error codes, steps taken, and if possible how to 

reproduce the problem in a controlled environment. Avoid flagging your question as *Urgent*. Finally, be courteous, and follow 

up with a brief note once the issue is resolved. 

## Examples
  Examples are the best way to learn. On stackoverflow, we can find instances of both well-communicated questions and poorly 

conveyed questions. For example, one user asks, “What does it mean to return a value?”. They express their confusion as a 

new programmer about the concept of returning a value. Elaborating on their understanding of returning a value, they provide

a snippet of their code along with the expected outcome. The users header is descriptive enough for an elementary level 

programming question, and included tags relevant to the issue. Their question was professional, concise, and addressed necessary 

information. This user received 4 answers that were helpful and included examples to better convey the solution. 

  In a separate post, a user asks, “The program should print random outputs, but in VSCode it is giving me the same output, why? 

[duplicate]”. The header itself is somewhat ambiguous which has led to it being marked as a duplicate. The user describes the 

expected output of their code and includes a snippet, noting that while they receive the expected outcome in C, they encounter 

issues in C++ . Here, the user is not being informative enough for people to fully understand the issue, and the post gives off 

the impression of a frustrated novice programmer. Consequently, this user did not receive constructive feedback, and even 

encountered some dismissive comments. Luckily, their question was flagged as a duplicate and redirected to relevant resources 

that might address their query.

## Conclusion
  Mastering the art of effectively conveying a question is a crucial skill. As an Electrical and Computer Engineering student, 

you’ll discover that this ability can either ease your academic endeavor, or conversely, create considerable challenges. However, 

effective communication extends beyond academics, and will be an indispensable asset throughout your professional career. As 

students, it is our responsibility to cultivate the skill of asking “smart questions” now, to avoid the bitter sting of poor 

communication later in the workplace. Lastly, understanding the nuances of communication will not only enhance your academic 

or professional life, but will also positively impact every facet of your personal life. Many of the challenges we encounter 

in life arise from miscommunication–whether it stems from ourselves or others. Thus, refining our communication skills is truly 

invaluable.


I will leave you with one of my favorite quotes: 
            *The fool who persists in his folly becomes wise.*

## So the story goes...

Though standards may seem trivial or inconsequential, they are what you would consider good bone structure 

upon which quality code is built, like the foundation of a well-constructed house. As a novice developer, 

you might find adhering to coding standards monotonous or even exasperatingly futile. Yet, you may not

have uncovered the subtle intricacies and significance that these guidelines bring to your craft. As you 

take on larger, more complex coding projects, you’ll come to realize that style isn’t merely a matter of 

preference; but rather a crucial role in coding standards.


## "Style, Schmyle"

Fret not, dear reader, for if you remain unconvinced; allow me to enlighten you. Good coding practices 

or standards is the expectation for production-level code, and there are compelling reasons for this.

Following a standard enhances readability-after all what good is your code if no one can read it? By 

adhering to coding standards your code tells a better story for future developers who need to rector 

or add new features to the codebase. 

If you’re wondering how developers remember all these standards, especially given the variation between

languages, you’re not alone. Linters are a developer's best friend; they are designed to enforce

specific coding standards and will, quite literally, yell at you in bright red lettering when you 

stray from the expected standards. The code you develop will rarely be for your eyes alone–coding 

standards make version control and collaboration far more seamless. 


## Isn't That Convenient?

You might be thinking that coding standards sound more like a convenience than a necessity. However, 

they are the backbone of safety, security, portability, and reliability of a project. Standards 

help prevent errors that could lead to security breaches or performance issues. I believe that

coding standards are often misunderstood. Like many, I eventually found myself invested in them. 

My code now tells a story, offers clear documentation for the lost wonderers of Github, and is 

easy on the eyes. Trust me, your colleagues will thank you, and soon enough, you’ll find yourself 

thanking them for following coding standards too.

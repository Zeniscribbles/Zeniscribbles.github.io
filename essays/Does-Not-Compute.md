## Background -
As an Electrical and Computer Engineering major it is a difficult task to give an unbiased opinion about TypeScript. 

It may do the reader well to explain why I am not without bias. My coding journey began with Python, a language that is a great 

starting point for those seeking basics, without the constraints of more complicated or low level programming languages. 

As an ECE major, I continued on in my journey and learned posix C, posix C++, MIPS/x86-64 assembly, and the bane of every engineer's 

existence; Matlab. My world is filled with the intricacies of navigating data and memory management through the mystical and powerful 

pointer. I was once told that, “The C coding language is sharp. If you’re not careful you will cut yourself” [1]. For a student who 

only fiddled in Python, this warning became the theme of my experience learning posix C/C++. 


## Reflection -
I can’t explain how quickly I fell in love with the C language, and yet nothing has exceeded the child like curiosity and excitement I 

experienced when I began learning about Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. So you see, I cannot honestly say that I have 

enjoyed my experience with TypeScript thus far. While I may never fully appreciate the significance of TypeScript in software engineering,

I firmly believe it is best suited for those professionals who dedicate their careers to mastering the more finer, often trivial, 

details of software development and web design.


## The Upside -
It has often eluded me why the University of Hawaii at Manoa included ICS 314 in our curriculum. It was not until recently that I learned 

it was the best possible substitute for the systems programming course that is no longer offered. With that being said, I am delighted to 

express that although TypeScript is not my cup of tea, ICS 314 does have extensive value as a course. The UH Manoa Engineering Department 

does a wonderful job providing endless amounts of workshops and seminars on developing our professional portfolio and leadership skills. 

However, our schedules often conflict with these amazing resources. I greatly appreciate that ICS 314 has thoughtfully allocated time within 

class sessions and assignments for students to begin developing their professional presence. 



## Why It Matters -
ICS 314 isn’t just about refining your coding skills, it also incorporates the reality of being a professional in the industry and the 

expectations it carries. On a more technical note, the choice of languages to learn in this course are concurrent with current industry practices. 

Being up to date with industry practices contributes to our quickly evolving technology, and is greatly encouraged by said industry. I believe 

that there is a balance to be achieved between academia and application and I find it very refreshing that ICS 314 has considered and implemented 

this ideology. Overall, I may find TypeScript to be a nightmare, but that is only my opinion. ICS 314 itself is very beneficial to any student who 

is ready to take their future career more seriously.

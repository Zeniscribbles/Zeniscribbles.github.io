## Interests 
For context, I am an Electrical and Computer Engineering major. My passion lies in Computer Architecture, 
Operating Systems, and Ethical Hacking. While I didn’t always have a clear direction, I was captivated early
on by the C and C++ language. A small spark of curiosity quickly blossomed into a deep love for the enigmatic 
fields of Computer Architecture and Operating Systems. Even now, I find myself wonderstruck by the intricate
inner workings of a computer, much like a child witnessing their first magic trick. And when the “magic” is 
unveiled and the mechanics understood, I remain endlessly spellbound. I have always had an itch for puzzles, 
which naturally led me to the world of Ethical hacking. It wasn’t long before I immersed myself into the 
complexities of stack overflows, rootkits, Ghidra, and GDB. At some point, I became acutely aware of just how 
vulnerable our cherished computers are. This realization both terrified me and excited me, cementing my passions
into a clear career path.

## Self Growth
When the path before me became clear, I felt compelled to make a list of the skills that would benefit me, 
but also captivate my interest. I was once told that, Good hackers have a deep understanding of Computer 
Architecture and Operating systems [1]. As undergraduates, we often encounter courses that are overly 
generalized and frustratingly superficial in their scope. It's just enough inspiration to keep us on the 
edge of our seats. Of course, this approach is to make sure as students we are diversified and well rounded. 
Luckily there is a very simple solution to this predicament, and that is to find a professor who can act 
as a mentor and guide us on our career endeavors. Alongside a mentor, selecting undergraduate projects that 
are directly aligned with our career aspirations is absolutely essential. I was fortunate enough to find a 
visiting professor who was already living the life I aspired to. He was the expert in the field I was so 
vehemently pursuing.

Over the next year, I plan to focus on enhancing my knowledge of Computer Architecture and Operating systems, 
further developing current skills in Ghidra and GDB, learning basic WiFi hacking, getting certifications such as 
Security+, and refining my coding skills in languages such as C, Assembly, Python, and SQL. To achieve these 
goals, I have enrolled in project courses on WiFi Security Exploitation, and graduate level courses as technical 
electives. In addition to more specialized courses, I am exploring internships with the Department of Defense. 
Lastly, utilizing sites like udemy for learning outside the classroom. Overall, my goal is to begin developing 
the basic skills necessary for a future career in Ethical Hacking.

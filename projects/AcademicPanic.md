---

[Academic Panic](https://academic-panic.github.io/) is a web application made using Next.js. The goal of the web-app is to encourage students in STEM, mainly engineering and computer science, to form connections with their fellow classmates to study together. Students sign up using their hawaii.edu account and can add their classes based on instructor, semester, and the year they took it. After adding their classes, students can then create "panic sessions" to invite other people who took or are taking the same class to study and get to know who is in their class.

This web app was designed as a final project for ICS314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, fall 2025.

Expected Student Outcomes:
- Understand Software Engineering Principles
- Understand Software Development Practices
- Experience team projectss
- Develop a web application using Next.js, Bootstrap-5, React, and other languages and frameworks
- Implement a print function to display characters on the screen
- Experience professional programming standards

summary: "A web application aimed to encourage students in STEM to get together to form study groups, otherwise known as \"panic sessions\", to facilitate better study habbits and reinforcement of knowledge."
---

[Academic Panic](https://academic-panic.github.io/) is a dynamic web application built with Next.js, designed to empower STEM students—particularly those in engineering and computer science—to collaborate and excel academically. The platform fosters connections among classmates by enabling students to sign up with their hawaii.edu accounts, add their courses by instructor, semester, and year, and create "panic sessions." These sessions serve as collaborative study groups where students can invite peers who are currently enrolled in or have previously taken the same classes. Academic Panic not only supports effective group learning but also strengthens academic networks within the student community.
This web app was designed as a final project for ICS314 at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, fall 2025.

Expected Student Outcomes:
- Understand Software Engineering Principles
- Understand Software Development Practices
- Experience team projectss
- Develop a web application using Next.js, Bootstrap-5, React, and other languages and frameworks
- Experience professional programming standards

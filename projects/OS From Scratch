**Operating System From Scratch** is a student project focused on writing a 64-bit operating system from scratch for the x86 architecture. The course provides a hands-on approach to understanding key concepts in OS development.

### Expected Student Outcomes:

* Understand real mode
* Understand protected mode and long mode
* Handle interrupts and exceptions in 64-bit mode
* Write an OS kernel using assembly and C code
* Implement a print function to display characters on the screen
* Build a memory manager using x86 paging
* Develop a timer handler for process management
* Create a process manager to handle scheduling and state transitions
* Implement a system call module for user programs
* Write a PS/2 keyboard driver
* Develop a simple console for interacting with the OS kernel
* Create a basic file system module supporting FAT16

Operating System From Scratch** is a student project focused on writing a 64-bit operating system 
from scratch for the x86 architecture. The course provides a hands-on approach to understanding key 
concepts in OS development.

Expected Student Outcomes:
- Understand real mode
- Understand protected mode and long mode
- Handle interrupts and exceptions in 64-bit mode
- Write an OS kernel using assembly and C code
- Implement a print function to display characters on the screen
- Build a memory manager using x86 paging
- Develop a timer handler for process management
- Create a process manager to handle scheduling and state transitions
- Implement a system call module for user programs
- Write a PS/2 keyboard driver
- Develop a simple console for interacting with the OS kernel
- Create a basic file system module supporting FAT16
